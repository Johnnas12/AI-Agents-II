Crypto markets are showing slight declines across the board over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies, are down less than 1%, with Bitcoin at $95,569 and Ethereum at $1,830.  Solana and Notcoin experienced slightly larger dips, with Solana down 1.39% to $146.36 and Notcoin losing 1.82% to $0.00225. Overall sentiment appears cautiously bearish in the short term, given the widespread declines, although the magnitude of the losses suggests relatively low volatility.
